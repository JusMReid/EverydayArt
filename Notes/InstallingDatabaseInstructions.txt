Installing database:

Start your wampserver exe, open menu in bottom right and wait for the "W" icon to turn from red to green.

right click "W" and click on phpmyadmin, sign in with 
username:root 
password:

create a new database called everydayart

under that database select Import

find everydayart.sql in folder

import will either accept everydayart.sql or will need the sql to be in a zip to import.

Getting to the site page:

go to your main directory(ex. C:) -> then to wamp64(or whatever your wamp is saved as) folder -> open www folder and copy and paste the entire folder of everydayart here. all the files must be in a folder called "everydayart"

now everything is set up to work. open your browser and type in localhost/everydayart/

everything that has been completed so far is reachable from here.
